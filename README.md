A group project created during my time at Enspiral Dev Academy, which incorporates the following technologies:

 - Express
 - Knex
 - SQLite3
 - Express Handlebars
 - body-parser
 - nodemon

This had a heavy focus on back end tech, with a major use of Knex, Express and SQLite.

At this stage of our EDA bootcamp, we were looking into older tech which is why Express Handlebars was used in this case.

## Install

```
npm install
npx knex migrate:latest
npx knex seed:run
npm run dev
```
